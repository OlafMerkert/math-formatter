* mathematical expressions
essentially we just want to describe these by giving them abstract shape
** sums (with minus signs, or other stuff)
** ratios / fractions
** products
** parentheses
** function calls
** underlying mathematical objects
** variables with reference to definition?
** exponents / superscripts
** indizes / subscripts

* colouring
** automatic
** explicit
** custom predicates/functions returning colour

* display styles
** automatic factorisation
** valuating at one place

* output formats
** Mathematica
this should be considered carefully, because this is about than presentation.
** LaTeX
** text output (supposedly similar to TeX)
** CLIM UI output
** LISP code
same issues as with mathematica output

* input formats
** math-utils data
** formula in lisp style
